                            Town Landing Market has been a part of the Falmouth community
                            since the late 1800s.  Its presence on Foreside Road has
                            spanned three centuries. It is more than a store.  
                            We consider it to be an institution in the community, and
                            it is our responsibility to nurture its legacy and serve
                            the community which we hope to do for years to come.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Families have been coming to the Town Landing Market for
                            generations. They, like us, are loyal and invested in the
                            success of the market and the entire Foreside community.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Our goal is to show our customers that when they walk
                            into Town Landing Market, a smiling friendly face will greet
                            them and provide whatever it is that they need at that moment,
                            whether it’s fresh lobsters for a lobster bake, one of our famous
                            lobster rolls or "Italian"sandwiches, or fresh breads and buns from
                            the local bakeries.
                          </p>
