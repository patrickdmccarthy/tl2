                  Our mission is to keep the generations-old familiar neighborhood
                  convenience while bringing more local and sustainable foods
                  to our community. We aim to keep our great relationship with our
                  customers but to increase our relationships and support of local
                  farmers, fisherman, lobstermen, artisans and merchants, bringing
                  more healthy and sustainable options to our patrons. 
                </p>

                  We aim to provide healthy, nutritious food for our customers.
                  We hope to build a deep relationship with the community and
                  customer base in order to understand and meet their needs.
                  We provide delicious fresh foods prepared in-house and by local
                  vendors. We have established relationships with local fishermen
                  and lobstermen. The market is now offering more local farm
                  products; vegetable, dairy and meat. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the spirit of giving back to the community and supporting local
                  NGOs, we are committed to supporting local charitable organizations
                  like the Falmouth Land Trust.
                  We are also thrilled to be a refreshment stop each year
                  during the Maine Marathon held in October and ask our
                  neighbors to stop by the market and cheer on the runners
                  and offer them refreshments as they run the race of their life!
